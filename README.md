# OZONE

Ozone is a game where you have to be quick and meticulous! A grid of icons will be
displayed, and it is up to you to find the different negative panda, or the different
happy shiba! Can you find the odd one out?
This game needs the player to sharpen their senses to zone in on the odd one out in
the board. The player may opt to choose between three difficulties: easy, medium, and
hard. Each level differs only with the play time allotted for the player.
(HINT: HARD MODE IS HARD.)
This game tracks the name and score of the previous player in the game, so you'll know
what and who to beat.

This game is comprised of four Python (.py) files: **game.py**, which contains the engine
and also runs the game; **elements.py**, which contains classes that make important game
objects; **interface.py**, which contains the interface elements; and **text_input.py**, which
handles text input for the end of the game. This game also uses media files which also
contribute to the gameplay.
